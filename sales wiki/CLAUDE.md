# CLAUDE.md — Sales Wiki Schema
> Operating manual for maintaining this knowledge base. Read at the start of every session.

## 1. WIKI PURPOSE

This is the **100xEngineers sales team's second brain**. A persistent, compounding knowledge base that helps sales reps sell the Applied AI cohort to any kind of lead — engineers, designers, marketers, founders, managers, doctors, animators, game designers, and anyone else.

It is NOT a script library. It provides nuances, framings, facts, and domain intelligence that reps use to make a better case in their own voice.

Three moments it serves:
1. **Pre-call** — understand the lead, prepare angle and relevant story
2. **Mid-call** — map cohort to their domain, handle objections with intelligence
3. **Post-call** — draft personalized WhatsApp follow-up

The wiki gets richer with every source added. Cross-references should already exist when answering rep questions.

## 5. LOG FORMAT (`wiki/log.md`)

Append-only. Format: `## [YYYY-MM-DD] action | description`
Valid actions: `ingest`, `query`, `lint`, `update`

---

## 6. OPERATIONS

### 6.1 INGEST (new source added to raw/)
1. Read the source file
2. Create `wiki/sources/[name].md`
3. Create or update `wiki/concepts/` pages
4. Create or update `wiki/entities/` pages
5. Update `wiki/index.md`
6. Update `wiki/overview.md` if materially changes the picture
7. Append to `wiki/log.md`
8. Flag contradictions explicitly

### 6.2 QUERY (rep asks a question)
1. Read `wiki/index.md` to find relevant pages
2. Read those pages
3. Synthesize answer with [[wiki page]] citations
4. For domain-specific questions: combine wiki knowledge + Claude web search for current AI trends in that domain
5. Return nuances, framings, facts — NOT scripts. Rep delivers in their own voice.

### 6.3 LINT (periodic health check)
- Find orphan pages, outdated claims, missing cross-references
- Suggest missing pages for frequently-mentioned concepts

---

## 7. CONVENTIONS

- Filenames: lowercase, hyphen-separated (kebab-case)
- Links: Obsidian `[[wiki-link]]` format
- Dates: ISO format YYYY-MM-DD
- Never write "I" in wiki pages
- Contradictions: flag with `> [!warning] Contradiction:` callout
- Common tags: `sales`, `framing`, `objection`, `domain`, `cohort`, `100x`, `zahid`, `persona`

---

## 8. SALES-SPECIFIC QUERY BEHAVIOR

When a rep describes a lead situation, always:
1. Pull the most specific matching domain/persona context
2. Combine with web search for current AI trends in their domain
3. Map relevant cohort modules to their world (Diffusion → Full Stack → LLMs → Agents)
4. Suggest the closest matching success story
5. Identify likely objections and relevant framings
6. Keep response brief — rep is on a call

**The goal is never to give a script. Give the ammunition. The rep fires it in their own voice.**

---

## 9. CURRENT STATE

- **Initialized:** 2026-04-16
- **Domain:** 100xEngineers Applied AI Cohort sales
- **Sources ingested:** 2 (Zahid's calls, objection playbook)
- **Pending sources:** cohort curriculum, success stories by domain (tomorrow)
